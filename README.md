# hello-world

boots and straps make the world go 'round.

i will explain more about myself here. this learning project is a continuation of my love for coding and developing web apps. i started coding at 14 to help our family business undetake new technological challenges. as marketing evolved in the early 2000s, business needed to bring their products to new marketplaces. the internet was the conduit, what we needed was a boat. thats where i came in.
// this is a description of my first attempt at coding.
